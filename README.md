# SolarSystemV2
This project is being developed by Jhon Anderson Urbano Díaz and Manuel Alejandro Ordoñez. The purpose is to create a new application capable of monitoring a solar system composed by one IoT device (ESP32) and an application to visualize the data and upload it to the server.

## Folders

### ESP32
> It contains the codes made in Visual Studio Code. For each of the sensors and actuators of the solar panel
> characterization circuit with their respective calibrations. Additionally, it presents the WI-FI communication
> files of the ESP32 and the files of couminication with the server.

### Hardware
> It presents the files of the circuit of characterization of solar panels made in Proteus; as simulations, PCB models 
> and 3D models of the components used in the circuit.

### Matlab
> In this session you will find the files made in Matlab for the mathematical calculation of the RC digital filter and 
> the obtaining of the PID variables for the solar panel characterization plant.

### Mockups
> It presents the files of the visual part of the mobile application.

### SolarApp
> In this section you will find the files of the mobile application, made in Visual Studio.
